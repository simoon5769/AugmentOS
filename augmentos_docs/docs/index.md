# Intro to the AugmentOS SDK Beta

*Last updated: March 31, 2025*

## What is AugmentOS?

AugmentOS is a cloud operating system for smart glasses that handles the hard parts: connections, Bluetooth, streaming, and more. This lets you focus on creating great smart glasses apps.

<div style={{maxWidth: '515px', margin: '0 auto'}}>
  <AugmentOSArchImage width="100%" />
</div>

As a Cloud OS, you can write apps in JavaScript/TypeScript (with Python coming soon) and use our SDK to build for smart glasses. Our SDK enables you to access smart glasses I/O with low latency from a cloud application.

## Compatible Hardware

You'll need [compatible smart glasses](https://augmentos.org/glasses/) to build with AugmentOS.
