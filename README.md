AugmentOS is the *the* way to build apps for smart glasses. The [AugmentOS SDK](https://console.augmentos.org) enables:
- Your app to immediately runs on any pair of smart glasses.
- Simple + fast dev - focus on building a great experience.
- Continuously access smart glasses I/O.
- Run always - run your app for days straight, guaranteed.
- Get seen - get your app in front of everyone using smart glasses.

AugmentOS enables you to run multiple apps *at the same time* so you can truly take advantage of AI-first wearables apps. Apps that run proactively based on context. That's the power of a smart glasses operating system.
